          most wizarding children in the United Kingdom and its surrounding
          areas, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and
          muggles.

          He is the headmaster of Hogwarts and he is the founder and leader of
          the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord
          Voldemort.<br />
          He is a mentor of Harry Potter.Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows
          that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him
          for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what
          he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits
          Harry to confront things heâ€™d rather protect him from.
